            She was raised in a poor single mom household with four other siblings.  
            At the age of ten, she dropped out of school and started working odd-end
            jobs to help with the family's financial need.  She continued working to 
            help support the family until she married her first husband.   After the 
            passing of her mother, and divorced her first husband.  She remarried to

            At the beginning of the year, the garden was set up to help occupy her 
            time and provide the family's fresh vegetables.   At the end of planting 
            season, her garden has more than two hundred plants. Most of the vegetables 
            are Thai vegetables that she likes to eat.  The garden produces more than 
            enough vegetables for the family to eat and to freeze for the winter.   
            On the weekend, she takes the additional vegetables to sell at the flea 
            market.  Next year, she plans to grow more vegetables and expand to a 
            bigger garden to add more varieties.
